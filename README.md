# house-price-predictor-using-linear-regression
random data for 15 houses. Size,Bedrooms,Age as Features and price as target split 30% data for testing and 70% for training the model the formula y=b+m1x1+m2x2+m3x3 where:
y=price
x1=size
m1=slope of size
x2=bedrooms
m2=slope of bedrooms
x3=age
m3=slope of age
b=intercept
trained the model and used 30 percent test data to test the model predicted the value then compared them with orignal value mse was 68251209 model can also predict data for new house
